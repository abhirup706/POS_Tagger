Implementation Using HMM:

1. I have not used any external libraries except numpy hence nothing is to be installed explicitly.
2. The path of the modified_brown corpus has been added while calling the load_corpus method. that has to be changed to your local path to the corpus.
3. the sentence to be evaluated needs to be passed to the viterbi_algorithm function in the end of the code.

Implementation using RNN:

1. The google collab link is given below:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14_aN97XyeKsDFkNF0rVz2b8BZQo0Gv4R?usp=sharing

2. I have used mounted my google drive and loaded the modified_brown corpus onto it. You migght have to change it
(Only on line number 72 of load_corpus function)

3. I have originally tried with the parameters provided in the problem statement and then changed it to view the results.
